# Tindify: A Matchmaking Application that Uses Song Streaming Data

The team believes that using demographic information as the sole basis for making user recommendations could lead to friendships and relationships that are fragile as Tinder tends to only use information inputted by each user to create profiles. Although Tinder tends to use social media information for users that log in through OAuth, this information collected may actually be not useful given that it is easy for individuals to make alternative personas online. With this, the team believes that it is necessary for dating platforms to utilize information that reveals the characteristics of each individual user as this is indicative of their actual behaviors and personalities. Hence, our team of data engineers have made Tindify, a matchmaking application that uses song streaming information of each user (which is collected from Spotify) in order to match two individuals who have similar music tastes.
